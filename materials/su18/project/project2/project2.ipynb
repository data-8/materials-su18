    "Welcome to Project 2!  You will investigate the major causes of death in the world, as well as how one of these causes, heart disease, might be linked to diet!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday 7/24. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Your partner must be enrolled in the same lab as you are. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/su18/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",

    "All of the concepts necessary for this project are found in the textbook. If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section often will help clarify the concept.\n",

In this institution, the subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups: half of the subjects were fed meals cooked with saturated fats, and half of the subjects were fed meals cooked with polyunsaturated fats. For example, the latter groups' oils were replaced with vegetable oils, specifically corn oils, and their butter was replaced with margarine. Notice that the subjects did not know which food they were getting. This is known as a ** blind** study. \n",
